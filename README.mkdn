## To setup build environment

Firsly, install `git`, using whatever package manager has.

Then, run these commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts
cd scripts
bash setup/<name of script>
```

android-build-env.sh is for Ubuntu/Linux Mint/other distributions using the `apt` package manager
The rest are named as per the distro

If running Arch Linux, please enable multilib, and install yaourt, before running the script :)
Please choose the name depending on the distro you have =)

Enjoy!
