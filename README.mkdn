## To setup build environment

Firstly, install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) , using the package manager in your distro.

Then, run these commands

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts
$ cd scripts
$ bash setup/<name of script>
```

`android_build_env.sh` is for Ubuntu/Linux Mint/other distributions using the `apt` package manager.
The rest are named as per the distro.

If running Arch Linux, please enable multilib before running the script :)
Please run the correct script depending on the distro you have installed!

Enjoy!
